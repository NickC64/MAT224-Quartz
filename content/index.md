title: Sheldon Axler Theorem Tree

Hi, welcome to my humble homepage.

Here I will post links to useful resources on the most recent weeks. If you want to make edits to this site, feel free to clone my [git repository](https://github.com/NickC64/MAT224-Quartz.git) and make a pull request.

On each page is a graph you can expand (graph icon in the top right corner) to see all the theorems displayed on the theorem tree. An arrow pointing from A to B signifies that B uses A in its proof, or B mentions A.

<h2>Matrices and Matrix Multiplication</h2>

Some important theorems to learn the proof of to derive the rest: 

[[2.19 Linear Dependence Lemma]]

[[2.30 Every spanning list has a basis]]

[[2.32 Every linearly independent list extends to basis]]
